        This is a homework assignment. Rewritten with hooks instead of classes,
        TypeScript. Utilizing <span>Formik</span> for forms,
        <span> yup</span> for validation,
        <span> Styled Components</span> for styling,
        <span> Styled System</span> for theming, <span>Box</span> custom utility
        component.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point you're able to add/remove contacts, filter existing ones,
        duplicates are ignored, alert informs about duplication.
      </p>
      <p>Styling is basic, styled components and Box mostly.</p>
